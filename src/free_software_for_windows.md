# Free Software for Windows

Here are some tips on useful free and/or open source software for
Windows, to make your life easier.\
\
I try to keep this list short - only the best of breed. Let me know if
there are some glaring omissions, but I\'m not trying to list every
application out there. I use most of the listed programs regularly, but
some of them I have only tried briefly.\
\
Disclaimer: I accept no responsibility for any consequences of you using
these programs. Read the licenses properly if you need to know if you
can use them in your workplace.
